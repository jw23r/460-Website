    <div class="info"><h1 class="italc" id="about1" >About Burundi</h1><p id="PG1"> Burundi might look like a small speck on a map, but because it's so densely populated it's home to many people. Ravaged by <a class="blue">civil war, massacre, and genocide,</a> the people of Burundi have had it rough. Two thirds of the population live in poverty, existing on <a class="blue">less than $1 a day</a></p><h1 class="italc" id="about2">About Turame</h1><p id="PG2">Making a difference can be difficult, and sometimes helping people half-way around the world seems impossible. Fortunately, there is an organization called <a class="brown">Turame</a> that was founded to help fight poverty in Burundi. Turame raises money to finance micro-loans for impoverished families, widows, and refugees. Rather than give the money away, Turame works with loan recipients to form lasting investments, to build small businesses, and to teach self-sufficiency.</p><h1 class="italic" id="about3">So what can I do to help?</h1><p id="PG3">To spread awareness and raise funds, we (a West Michigan youth group) have decided to hold a 24-hour gaming marathon. Friends, family, and community members are welcome to come play games in exchange for small donations. We're going to try to stream out a live video, so anyone can join us in spirit -- feel free to donate online as well! All funds raised will be donated to Turame.</p><img src="imgs/map.png"> </div>
